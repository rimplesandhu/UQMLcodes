:: 0_generate.py
Generates the noisy observations to be used for sparse learning and bayesian linear regression

:: 1_BLRrhoknown.py
Bayesian linear regression code assuming observation error precision (rho) is known. Uses conjugate prior (Normal) for parameter vector w to compute posterior pdf and log-evidence analytically.

:: 2_BLR.py
Bayesian linear regression code where both w and rho are unknown. Uses Normal-Gamma conjugate prior NG(m0,V0,a0,b0) to obtain posterior pdf and log-evidence analytically.

:: 3_SBLorig.py
Sparse Bayesian learning code that involves iterative re-estimation procedure for hyper-parameter estimation.   
Ref: Michael E. Tipping.  Sparse bayesian learning and the relevance vector machine. 2001.

:: 4_SBLfast.py
Sparse Bayesian leanring code that involves fast suboptimal iterative addition/deletion procedure for basis selection.

:: 5_BCS.py
Bayesian compressive sensing code that uses two-level hierarchical prior for inducing sparsity.
